My current research interests is on reinforcement learning, language agents & reasoning, sampling techniques, and contextual bandits. I am currently building Machine Learning algorithms @ Apple, where I am building environments, benchmarks, and evals to train RL agents at scale. To this end, I believe that research in scalable supervision is crucial to train next-generation models as they grow in complexity and as their applications extend towards domains where we can no longer define rewards easily.

I received my doctorate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Dr. Xiaoning Qian. During my studies, I researched uncertainty quantification and variational inference in machine learning, with applications toward continual learning, anomaly detection, model compression & energy-efficiency in areas such as computer vision, recommender systems, time-series prediction, and healthcare monitoring. My work has been published in conferences such as ICML, AAAI, AISTATS, and NeurIPS, as well as healthcare journals such as JHIR and Surgical Infections.
