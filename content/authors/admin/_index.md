I am a PhD candidate in the Biomedical & Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) Lab in Texas A&M University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, with Professor Xiaoning Qian as my advisor. 

My current interests are in uncertainty quantification in machine learning, with applications to time-series prediction, computer vision, energy-efficient ML, anomaly detection, continual learning, deep model compression, and healthcare.
