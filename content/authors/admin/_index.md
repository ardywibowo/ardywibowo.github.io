My current research interests is on reinforcement learning, language agents & reasoning, sampling techniques, and contextual bandits. I am currently building Machine Learning algorithms @ Apple Inc.

I received my doctorate in Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Dr. Xiaoning Qian. During my studies, I researched uncertainty quantification in machine learning, with applications to time-series prediction, computer vision, energy-efficient ML, anomaly detection, continual learning, deep model compression, and healthcare monitoring.
