In fall of 2014, I conducted research under Dr. Robin Murphy. This research was in the field of emergency informatics. In particular, I was tasked with designing an Augmented Reality (AR) interface for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. This AR interface, called AerialAR, would label locales such as schools or hospitals in images or videos received from a UAV. This is important for disaster responders, as they needed the ability to remotely determine mission relevant locations such as schools which may need evacuating or hospitals where victims may be transported.



I had never conducted research before so I was slightly anxious to start. In hindsight, research was very difficult for me. Along with my courses, research took up so much of my time that I hardly had any left to relax in the weekend. This is because the research demanded that I create a new set of equations based on geometric relations between the UAV and the locations in the imagery. This took a lot of study in the nature of optics, motion tracking, aviation terminology, and geo-positioning conventions.



Ultimately, I successfully implemented the interface and even submitted my findings to the CHI 2015 conference in South Korea. More importantly, I gained valuable experience as an engineer and as a person. Firstly, I gained a good work ethic. Throughout the progress of my research, I would periodically keep my professor updated with my findings. This required me to work hard every day in order to show significant results.



Secondly, I learned good time management. This is important for me, as with my course load at the time, I had barely enough time to finish any of my work. Initially, I would have to stay up very late at night to complete my homework, finish my projects, and do my research. However, after coping with the work load, I learned to manage my time well. With good time management, I acquired a new perspective on responsibility. I now understand that being responsible sometimes calls for sacrificing a lot of recreational time to finish work.

I also obtained good learning habits. Since my research required a lot of prior knowledge, I had to study many things in many different fields. Learning skills are essential for research, but also throughout life as well. I realize now that, similar to research, life is a journey of continuous learning. I noticed this as I would often receive ideas for my research from ordinary phenomena in everyday life.



Above all, I got to help people with real life problems using the skills that I know. This not only increased my determination in the field Iâ€™m studying, but also gave me a new perspective on life. I know now that life will be brighter when everyone is willing to help each other towards a common good.
