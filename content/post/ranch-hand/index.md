Final senior design project sponsored by Texas Instruments. I created a web app that connects with a mesh network Internet of Things (IoT) through Amazon Web Service (AWS). [[Report](/papers/ranch-hand.pdf)] [[Source Code](https://github.com/ardywibowo/RanchHand)] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD-po7wXn5k)] [[Jason Barn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMdEP-M_pK0)].

### Team Composition

The team consisted of 4 people:

- Jeff Bartlett: Mesh Network Subsystem
- Connor Furqueron: Power Subsystem
- Charles Anderson: Microcontroller Subsystem
- Randy Ardywibowo: Data Analysis/App Development

### Methodology

In the following video, I have laid out the general procedure of the data processing part of this project. It mainly consists of data generation, optimal sensor placement, and trilateration algorithm.

An example of the main view of the web app is shown below:

### Reflection

In the end, despite team difficulties, we finished an interesting IoT application. 

Here is a cool advertisement video/movie of our project. To be honest, the video doesn't contain a lot of technical merit, but I would be wrong if I said that it isn't amazing. Enjoy :).
