abstract: 'A method performed by a deep neural network (DNN) includes receiving, at a layer of the DNN during an inference stage, a layer input comprising content associated with a DNN input received at the DNN. The method also includes quantizing one or more parameters of a plurality of parameters associated with the layer based on the content of the layer input. The method further includes performing a task corresponding to the DNN input, the task performed with the one or more one quantized parameters.'
